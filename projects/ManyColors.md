summary: "An app used to showcase what colors you get when you mix up to two colors!"
---
My project uses a checked list where the user can select up to 2 colors while optionally they can also just select one. After a player has chosen their colors, they merge them with the merge button, changing the background of the app to that color. The player can then click the reset button to return the color back to white and uncheck the list to do it all again.
